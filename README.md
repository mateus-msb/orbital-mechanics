# Orbital Mechanics

## Overview
This repository aims to analyze the performance and numerical precision of an orbit propagator, incorporating simple perturbations (Atmospheric Drag and J2), while also facilitating the implementation of control laws in Python and Julia.

## Next Steps (14.02)
### Python 
- [ ] Implement J2 PErturbation
- [ ] Implement multiple satellites
- [ ] Insert control law
- [ ] Input from .txt file
- [ ] Output to results/


### Julia
- [ ] Create structs (Orbit, Satellites, etc.)
- [ ] Implement basic orbit (ODE)
- [ ] Implement orbital perturbations
- [ ] Input from .txt file
- [ ] Output to results/
